# Precbot
A Twitch bot that interacts with users via chat. All the avaliable commands can be found in [CommandsHandler.cs](https://github.com/finloop/Precbot/blob/master/Bot.Irc/Modules/CommandsHandler.cs). Some of them are:
- Joining custom channel
- Points system (getting points by watching and interacting)
- Roulette
- Checking viewers
- Some easter-eggs ðŸ˜‹

For a bot to work you need a Twitch api key, then put in in a config file. Its spec can be found in [Config.cs](https://github.com/finloop/Precbot/blob/master/Bot.Irc/Modules/Config.cs).

# Disclaimer
__I'm not sure it works (twitch might have changed its API).__
